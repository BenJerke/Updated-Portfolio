            I'm a 25-year-old software tester from Madison, Wisconsin. I grew up in the Midwest (Iowa and Minnesota), 
            and graduated from Luther College with a GPA of 3.6 in June of 2016. 
            <br>
            <br>

            In my spare time, I enjoy biking, reading, and making my friends laugh. I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp through the University of Wisconsin. 
            I aim to use this new skillset to better serve my current employer, and make personal projects that the internet at large can enjoy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to become a reliable source for unique website designs and content within six months. Stay tuned.
            if you don't fantasize about ripping dick cheney into pieces, we can't be friends
